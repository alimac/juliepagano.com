          %p I am a web developer (and burgeoning web designer) in Pittsburgh, PA. I came to Pittsburgh to get my BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and liked it so much I decided to stay.  In my free time, I like to indulge my cinephilia, read comic books, and play with my cat (I am a cat lady in training).
