      <h3>It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech</h3>
      <p>We talk a lot about the things people can do to get the most out of being a software developer. We talk about testing, design patterns, contributing to open source, and many other topics. All of these things are important, but for some of us there's an important piece of the puzzle being overlooked. It can be hard to focus on your love of coding when you are regularly battling invisible issues like insecurity, anxiety, and lack of confidence. These issues create hurdles that get in the way no matter how much you improve as a software engineer.</p>

      <p>It is important that we talk about these issues because an unwillingness to admit they're real can make it worse. It makes them feel like the adult version of the monsters under the bed. It's scary and isolating because those around you don't understand or actively deny what you're going through. It's dangerous to go alone! Let's start talking about these issues, so people have the tools and support to fight back.</p>

      <p>You may have experienced these issues first-hand and need some help. You may want to learn more, so you can help others. This talk is for all of you. I'll identify invisible issues programmers struggle with, talk about their impact, discuss personal experiences dealing with them, and share some tools I found useful in fighting back.</p>

      <h3>My Technology Will Be Intersectional or It Will Be Bullshit!</h3>
      <p>People have been talking a lot about diversity in technology, but talking isn't enough. We need to move beyond focusing on one group and start getting everyone involved. It's not really diversity until we start to account for the intersections of different types of people and actively do something.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will learn about intersectionality, discuss the importance of diversity, and identify things that we all can do to improve the situation. This talk will give you a reason to care about diversity and some tools to work towards improving it. It might even inspire you to join me in my rallying cry of "my technology will be intersectional or it will be BULLSHIT!"</p>
