If you have been here before, you may notice the site looks different this week.
I redesigned my site using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), an awesome
static site generator, so that
I could move away from WordPress and do things lean and simple. I am hoping to do
a write-up about the redesign some time soon, but that's not why I am here tonight.
I am here to address the lack of something that old and new visitors alike may have
expected -- the comments.

The new version of my site intentionally does not have comments.
Comment sections often become a nasty place where nobody wants to go. There's
a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/AvoidComments) that regularly
reminds people to avoid them for a reason. Hell, even Popular Science
[recently turned off comments](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments)
based on a study that showed they have negative consequences.
I am not interested in hosting a space where people spew invective at myself or
others. There are [plenty](http://www.reddit.com/)
of [other places](https://news.ycombinator.com/) where
people can have those conversations ad nauseum.

The few sites I frequent with quality comments
have dedicated moderators who spend a great deal of time and energy maintaining
a positive space. For some of them, it's pretty much a full-time job. I do not
have the time, energy, or willingness to put that kind of work into my site.
Sorry, commenters, I have a day job.

If you want to engage with me about my writing, you can find plenty of ways
to contact me on the [about](/about.html) section of my site. However, please
be respectful of my time. Please understand that I receive a large number of
emails and may not be able to respond to everyone. On a more sinister note,
if you send me threats, harassment, or abuse, please be aware that I may share
it with the internet and/or the authorities depending on the content (also, if you
do this you are a bad person and you should feel bad).

I am hoping the much simpler site management will encourage me to write more, so
that I can share my thoughts with people more often. I hope you will continue to join me on
my little corner of the internet.

For anyone who might be angry that there are no comments, tough shit. :)
