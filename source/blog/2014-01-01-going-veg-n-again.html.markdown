I'm trying to go mostly vegetarian again. "Mostly" meaning that I'll ocassionally allow myself to have seafood (mmmm, sushi). I'm not doing this as a silly new year's resolution -- I just waited until after the holidays to make holiday cooking easier on my parents.

I've tried some flavor of veg*n a few times in the past. I'd love some support and accountability from my friends to try to help it stick this time, so please feel free to share tips ([add info on github](https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com/issues/35) or tweet at me).

I want to keep track of the info people share with me and share it with others, so I'll collect it here. These are mostly recommendations from others, so I can't personally vouch for them. I'll add notes as I try things.
