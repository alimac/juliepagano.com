      Hi! My name is Julie.
    %p
      I am a web developer that focuses on user experience.  I spend most of my time working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I enjoy making things usable and pretty (despite my lack of a formal design background).
    %p
      I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA.  I originally came here to get my BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh (CMU was far too expensive).  I liked it so much that I decided to stay.
    %p
      In my free time, I enjoy indulging my cinephilia, geeky interests (science, skepticism, comics, video games, etc.), and love of cute animal pictures.
    %p
      I currently share my home with Nikita, my rescued feline friend.  She is currently helping train me in the ways of being a cat lady.
