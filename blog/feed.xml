    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use twitter quite a lot, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to explain why and how I use it. I think this is becoming increasingly necessary as I get more followers. They follow for a wide variety of reasons and some context may help minimize confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a long post. New followers should at least read the &lt;a href="#how-to-engage-with-me"&gt;How to Engage with Me&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-twitter?"&gt;Why Twitter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a little history. I created a twitter account in 2008. I tried to use it a few times, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a sense of why twitter was useful. It was a lot of noise with no signal to be found. A few years ago, I tried again. That time I found the signal that made it worth braving the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, twitter has enabled me to meet people all over the world with similar interests, passions, and values. People who have helped me learn and expand my worldview. People who support me and challenge me. People who I now consider friends &amp;ndash; yes, one can develop and maintain meaningful friendships over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot adequately use words to describe how valuable this has been to me, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try. It may be a surprise to some people, but I used to be a very quiet, passive person who rarely socialized or spoke up. The short answer for why is a combination of isolation and social anxiety. The friends I made on twitter helped immensely with both. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel isolated when you have friends all over the world willing to support you, who care about you. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easier to start finding your voice in text when you have social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to conferences in other cities, suddenly I had friends to look forward to hanging out with. When one of us had a rough day, people were at the ready to jump on a hangout to provide support. Girl Develop It Pittsburgh found the initial volunteers it needed on twitter. People on twitter provided me with the encouragement, support, and resources to start &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech/"&gt;speaking about impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter helped me meet people who I now consider very close friends. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s about the people, but the tool helped me find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-i-use-twitter"&gt;How I Use Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, I talked a little bit about using twitter as a tool to meet people and a tool for overcoming social anxiety. These were the initial ways I used twitter, but I have expanded to using this tool for so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uses"&gt;Uses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter as a tool for &lt;strong&gt;activism&lt;/strong&gt;. I might be trying to use it to raise awareness about a specific issue or calling attention to some harmful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime I use twitter as a tool for &lt;strong&gt;education&lt;/strong&gt;. I will spend time having difficult conversations and trying to teach an audience of one or many about a specific subject. Topics I tend to educate on include: feminism, diversity in tech, intersectionality, and impostor syndrome. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on any of these topics, but I know more than some, so I try to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to &lt;strong&gt;socialize&lt;/strong&gt;. I have a lot of friends on there in differing time zones, and it is often the most convenient place for us to joke, share, and chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter for &lt;strong&gt;humor&lt;/strong&gt; and silliness. Contrary to popular belief, feminists do have a sense of humor. My humor tends to be sarcastic, absurd, or involve A LOT OF SHOUTING!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to &lt;strong&gt;vent&lt;/strong&gt;. All of that activism and educating is hard, and it takes its toll. Venting is necessary to let off steam and regroup, so I can keep on keeping on. Sometimes I vent with friends because they need to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to post pictures of my &lt;strong&gt;cats&lt;/strong&gt; or random information about them. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much the cat mom equivalent of that person who won&amp;rsquo;t stop telling you about all the stuff their baby does (see example below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano/status/389919899310886912/photo/1"&gt;
  &lt;img src="kitties.jpg" alt="kitties" width="320"
       style="border-radius: 30px"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to livetweet &lt;strong&gt;movies&lt;/strong&gt; for fun. I created a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jurimovietweets"&gt;separate account&lt;/a&gt; for that because it&amp;rsquo;s a LOT of tweeting, and I am ok with separating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switch between all of the above types of tweeting with a fair amount of frequency. My impression is the context switches are fairly obvious to people who have followed me for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tagging"&gt;Tagging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to hashtag certain content, so it is easy for people to mute. I usually hashtag conference tweeting for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to remember to tag certain content because it&amp;rsquo;s triggering for followers, and they want to mute it. I try to trigger warn certain content or sections of tweets when I can. For a while, I trigger warned my entire account because I was doing activism about sexual assault and rape culture. I&amp;rsquo;m not perfect in any of this, and the 140 character limit sometimes makes it difficult, but I try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I regularly hit on a topic that&amp;rsquo;s triggering for you, please feel free to let me know. I make no promises that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to stop or tag it for you, but I will see if we can make something work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="posting-articles-and-retweeting"&gt;Posting Articles and Retweeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often post articles or retweet content that I find interesting or worthy of discussion. Unless I specfically say so, I do not intend for this to indicate full agreement with or endorsement of all content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="following"&gt;Following&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow a reasonable number of people, but I only regularly read a few. I heavily use lists. If I stop being interested in your feed, I may unfollow you. An unfollow is not an indication of my thoughts on you as a person &amp;ndash; it just means your feed wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for me. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to clean up my follows and keep things as lean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="blocking"&gt;Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I block people fairly easily. Twitter is a space where I choose to engage with people who increase the value of the experience for me. If you don&amp;rsquo;t respect my boundaries or the boundaries of my friends, I may block you. If you&amp;rsquo;re an asshole, I may block you. If you regularly say racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/ableist/etc. shit, I will very likely block you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed on a few occasions that people I like or don&amp;rsquo;t even know blocked me. I wondered to myself, &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;, and then let it be. They have a right to control their space on twitter. I am not entitled to interact with them. I recommend you deal with being blocked the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think I accidentally blocked you and are sad about this, feel free to email me about it. Otherwise, deal with it. You&amp;rsquo;re not entitled to interact with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="disclaimer"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts on twitter are my own and not those of my employer or other organizations I participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-to-engage-with-me"&gt;How to engage with me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing a lot of common points of confusion or frustration for people who try to engage with me on twitter. Here is some information that I hope will clear some of that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I context switch a lot. It is to your benefit to follow me for a little while to get a sense of what those contexts look like. Alternatively, ask if I&amp;rsquo;m being serious or joking about something. Assumptions without context tend to end poorly. If you do not enjoy the varying ways I use twitter or the context switching, I suggest not following me. It sounds like my feed is not a good fit for how you use twitter, and that&amp;rsquo;s totally ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognize twitter is 140 characters. It is not a space that allows for nuance, proper grammar, or good explanations. Asking for clarification on something is often useful. If I&amp;rsquo;m doing a long string of tweets (as I am wont to do when in activist or educator mode), read the associated tweets in my timeline for additional information before engaging. My email is on my &lt;a href="/about"&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt; if you want longform communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read my &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/"&gt;101 off limits list&lt;/a&gt; before engaging with me. If you hit one of the points on there, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to point you to it anyway. Intentionally hitting the points in there knowing I have requested not to discuss them shows you do not respect boundaries. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know that I have the right to end conversations or decline to engage in them. I do not always have the time or energy to educate or discuss. Asking to stop or declining to start is not rude. It is setting a boundary and asking you to respect it. I am not obligated to be constantly available to anyone. This is not my job, and nobody pays me to do it. I have a full-time job, groups I organize, and other things I want to spend my time on. When you get angry when I ask to stop, it sounds like you are angry that I have not prioritized &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; wants and needs over my own. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless I say an absolute all/every/always/etc., it&amp;rsquo;s very unlikely I mean an absolute. As &lt;a href="http://rarlindseysmash.com/posts/stupid-programmer-tricks-and-star-wars-gifs"&gt;my Star Wars loving friend&lt;/a&gt; reminded me, only a Sith deals in absolutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion-(and-tldr)"&gt;Conclusion (and tldr)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a useful tool. I have a bunch of friends on there. I use twitter a lot of different ways. I use it how I like. Respect my boundaries, and enjoy twitter however you like besides that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Site Redesign Using Middleman</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/blog/2013/11/10/site-redesign-using-middleman/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally redesigned my site and moved it over to a static site generated using &lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; and hosted using &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I would share a little bit about my process in case it helps anyone else going through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;a href="https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com"&gt;the repository for my project on Github&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to use it as a detailed reference for what I did, but don&amp;rsquo;t judge too harshly for the code quality. This was something I slapped together during some spare time, and it is not a good example of best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, my site lived on a locally hosted server with WordPress and a poorly hacked up custom theme. This was annoying to maintain, so I rarely made changes to the design or page layouts. My server got very sad (my ultra-technical way of saying it couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the load) any time I wrote a remotely interesting blog post that got some traffic. This was probably due to my lack of a decent server, my configuration of WordPress, or some combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit to being a WordPress novice, so this is probably on me. The thing is, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really need WordPress for what I was doing. It didn&amp;rsquo;t seem worthwhile to spend a lot of time learning how to configure it correctly and create a complex theme, when what I really wanted to do was quickly manage my design and focus on writing. Enter static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="picking-a-static-site-generator"&gt;Picking a static site generator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static site generator is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It&amp;rsquo;s a tool that assists you with creating a static site. The appeal of a static site for me was keeping things very simple. No databases. No complex framework I needed to learn. I just wanted to do some simple design work, write a little front-end code, and then focus on my writing. Another appeal of a static site was that it simplified hosting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are approximately &lt;a href="https://github.com/pinceladasdaweb/Static-Site-Generators"&gt;a bazillion different static site generators&lt;/a&gt; out there. Below is a rough prioritized list of what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for blogging functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration in a language I am familiar with or can pick up quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for my favorite front-end tools, particularly SASS and Compass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively maintained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to deploy to Github Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://octopress.org/"&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; (a framework on top of Jekyll) are pretty popular and incredibly easy to to deploy on Github Pages because &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages"&gt;Jekyll support is built-in&lt;/a&gt;. I played with Octopress briefly in the past and found myself fighting the built-in theming way too much. I had ok experiences with Jekyll in the past, but I vaguely recall being annoyed with some parts of the configuration, including setting it up to use SASS and Compass. Jekyll was a reasonable option, and my plan was to use it unless I found something more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; to be that something compelling. It met all my guidelines (see notes below), and I had pleasant memories of working with it in the past for some rapid prototyping work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/blogging/"&gt;Support for blogging functionality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/"&gt;Easy setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration in a language I am familiar with or can pick up quickly - in this case Ruby, ERB, Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/asset-pipeline/"&gt;Support for my favorite front-end tools, particularly SASS and Compass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Decent documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman/commits/master"&gt;Actively maintained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to deploy to Github Pages - done using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/neo/middleman-gh-pages"&gt;Middleman Github Pages gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="setting-up-middleman"&gt;Setting up Middleman&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to set up a recent version of Ruby before you get started. I used Ruby 2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="install-middleman"&gt;Install Middleman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;gem install middleman
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-your-project"&gt;Create your project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generated my project using the &lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/#toc_7"&gt;HTML5 Boilerplate project template&lt;/a&gt;, which sets up a bunch of basic things you will need using &lt;a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/"&gt;HTML5 Boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;. There are several other template options for you to choose from, if HTML5 Boilerplate doesn&amp;rsquo;t strike your fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;middleman init my_project --template&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;html5
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the code you will work with is in the &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="configuration"&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration for your middleman project lives in &lt;code&gt;config.rb&lt;/code&gt; in the root directory. They do not have full documentation on all the things you can set in there. You can explore the settings &lt;a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman/blob/master/middleman-core/lib/middleman-core/application.rb#L53"&gt;in their code&lt;/a&gt; and take a look at my configuration &lt;a href="https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com/blob/master/config.rb"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="start-the-server"&gt;Start the server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;my_project
middleman
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://localhost:4567"&gt;http://localhost:4567&lt;/a&gt; (or whatever port it specifies). If it works, you&amp;rsquo;ve got the basics set up now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="generate-a-static-site"&gt;Generate a static site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try building a static version of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;middleman build
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built static code goes into the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="switch-to-sass"&gt;Switch to SASS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I modified the CSS files I planned on working with from .css to .scss, so that I
could use &lt;a href="http://sass-lang.com/"&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt; for my stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="use-pretty-urls"&gt;Use pretty urls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following to &lt;code&gt;config.rb&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/pretty-urls/"&gt;pretty urls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:directory_indexes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="relative-links-and-assets"&gt;Relative links and assets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially had some annoyances getting links to pages and assets working properly
both locally and up on Github Pages because the directory structure was a little different. I was
able to get it working with the configuration below and sticking with using the &lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/helpers/"&gt;helpers&lt;/a&gt;
for internal links and assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set the following in &lt;code&gt;config.rb&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:relative_assets&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Build-specific configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:build&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:relative_links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default HTML5 Boilerplate code did not use the helpers for some of the asset
links, so I changed that in &lt;a href="https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com/commit/7c0dea6ab1b706452dcf3b4008218246f878bce2"&gt;this commit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="add-blogging"&gt;Add blogging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add blogging functionality to Middleman
using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman-blog"&gt;middleman-blog&lt;/a&gt; gem. I
recommend reading and following the &lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/blogging/"&gt;instructions in the Middleman documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get things set up, you can generate new articles with &lt;code&gt;middleman article&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;middleman&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;The Name of My Article&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will generate the file &lt;code&gt;source/blog/2013-11-11-the-name-of-my-article.html.markdown&lt;/code&gt; (or some other path if you configured things differently). You can then
add tags, modify the title, and write the content of your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight markdown"&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;The Name of My Article&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;2013-11-11 22:31 EST&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;middleman, blogging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
The body of my blog post.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="add-syntax-highlighting"&gt;Add syntax highlighting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added syntax highlighting using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman-syntax"&gt;middleman-syntax&lt;/a&gt; gem. This allowed me to add the code blocks to this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="deploying-to-github-pages"&gt;Deploying to Github pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; for hosting, you need to put your project on &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. Github Pages will
host static site files (e.g. html, css, js) placed in a branch named &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="set-up-middleman-github-pages"&gt;Set up Middleman Github Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="https://github.com/neo/middleman-gh-pages"&gt;Middleman Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; to handle deploying Middleman changes to my &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch. Follow the instructions in the readme and you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives you some simple rake tasks to take care of everything for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;rake build    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Compile all files into the build directory&lt;/span&gt;
rake publish  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Build and publish to Github Pages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="setup-up-custom-domain-name"&gt;Setup up custom domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file named &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; directory and put the domain (or subdomain) into the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight text"&gt;juliepagano.com
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages#setting-up-dns"&gt;configure your DNS&lt;/a&gt; to point to Github. As of the time I wrote this, you should set up an &lt;strong&gt;A record&lt;/strong&gt; pointing to &lt;code&gt;204.232.175.78&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="designing-the-site"&gt;Designing the site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a designer by trade, so I kind of &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing"&gt;have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="logo"&gt;Logo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only major element I carried over from the previous design of the site is the logo (designed using Adobe Illustrator). I like it as a visual representation that breaks me down to two basic characteristics: hair and glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this iteration of the site, I modified the logo to be sharper. I also created a 2x version of the logo that is used on retina devices. Below is a quick snippet of &lt;a href="https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com/blob/master/source/css/styles.scss"&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$logo-img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;logo.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$logo-img-2x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;logo-2x.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;image-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$logo-img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;image-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$logo-img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;image-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$logo-img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;image-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$logo-img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;min-resolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;192dpi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;image-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$logo-img-2x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="basic-design"&gt;Basic design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My design process was pretty basic. I wanted something flat and simple. I redesigned the site to focus on my writing, so it was important that my design made it easy to read longform text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with &lt;a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/"&gt;Kuler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/"&gt;Color Scheme Designer&lt;/a&gt; to select the basic color palette for the site. The starting color I worked from was the red shade of the hair in the logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responsive-design"&gt;Responsive design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people get links to blog posts on their phones and other devices, so it was important to me that my writing was readable on a variety of screen sizes. I used some very basic responsive design techniques to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see some examples of what I did by looking for the &lt;code&gt;@media&lt;/code&gt; queries in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com/blob/master/source/css/styles.scss"&gt;primary stylesheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fonts"&gt;Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://typekit.com"&gt;Typekit&lt;/a&gt; to provide my text fonts. The site is currently using &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova"&gt;Proxima Nova&lt;/a&gt; for regular text and &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/source-code-pro"&gt;Source Code Pro&lt;/a&gt; for code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="http://fontawesome.io/"&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; for the icons on the site. It is an icon
font that is super-easy to set up and use. I &lt;a href="http://fontawesome.io/get-started/"&gt;set up Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;strong&gt;Pro: Custom SASS&lt;/strong&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download Font Awesome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract and copy the &lt;code&gt;font-awesome&lt;/code&gt; directory to &lt;code&gt;source/css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;$fa-font-path&lt;/code&gt; variable in &lt;code&gt;font-awesome/scss/_variables.scss&lt;/code&gt; to point to your font directory where you put the Font Awesome font files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import Font Awesome in your stylesheet: &lt;code&gt;@import &amp;quot;font-awesome/font-awesome&amp;quot;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the icon-fonts via custom classes. There are a bunch of helpful &lt;a href="http://fontawesome.io/examples/"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; for how to do this in their documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of fun to play around with a little design and a somewhat new framework. I was able to get things up and running fairly quickly once I actually sat down and worked at it. It is easy to update and work with, so I feel validated in the choices that I made based on my original goals. Hopefully, you will see a lot more writing from me now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared a somewhat random smattering of my process above. I might try to write up some additional pieces later, but I wanted to get something out now. Feel free to &lt;a href="/about"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com/issues"&gt;file an issue&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions or want me to cover additional topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially please read them before asking survivors to give you the answers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shakesville has a “today in rape culture” tag that can help you understand how frequent and horrible this is. &lt;a href="http://t.co/EccbJRE8eg"&gt;&lt;a href="http://t.co/EccbJRE8eg"&gt;http://t.co/EccbJRE8eg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Julie the Wizandrist (@juliepagano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano/statuses/387764704598589440"&gt;October 9, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don’t recommend reading too many of them in a row though, lest you lose all your faith in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Julie the Wizandrist (@juliepagano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano/statuses/387764754250760192"&gt;October 9, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schrödinger’s Rapist is a great post about how it feels to be a woman living in a world with rape culture. &lt;a href="http://t.co/5gYFZi74e8"&gt;&lt;a href="http://t.co/5gYFZi74e8"&gt;http://t.co/5gYFZi74e8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Julie the Wizandrist (@juliepagano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano/statuses/387766267463368704"&gt;October 9, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of guys have a strong negative reaction to that last one. Before you respond, think about that reaction. Sit with it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Julie the Wizandrist (@juliepagano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano/statuses/387766410010951681"&gt;October 9, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on that note, yes I know men are raped too. It’s rarely talked about. That’s another part of rape culture.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Julie the Wizandrist (@juliepagano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano/statuses/387766736176828416"&gt;October 9, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have been here before, you may notice the site looks different this week.
I redesigned my site using &lt;a href="http://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;, an awesome
static site generator, so that
I could move away from WordPress and do things lean and simple. I am hoping to do
a write-up about the redesign some time soon, but that&amp;rsquo;s not why I am here tonight.
I am here to address the lack of something that old and new visitors alike may have
expected &amp;ndash; the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new version of my site intentionally does not have comments.
Comment sections often become a nasty place where nobody wants to go. There&amp;rsquo;s
a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AvoidComments"&gt;twitter account&lt;/a&gt; that regularly
reminds people to avoid them for a reason. Hell, even Popular Science
&lt;a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments"&gt;recently turned off comments&lt;/a&gt;
based on a study that showed they have negative consequences.
I am not interested in hosting a space where people spew invective at myself or
others. There are &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/"&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;other places&lt;/a&gt; where
people can have those conversations ad nauseum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few sites I frequent with quality comments
have dedicated moderators who spend a great deal of time and energy maintaining
a positive space. For some of them, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much a full-time job. I do not
have the time, energy, or willingness to put that kind of work into my site.
Sorry, commenters, I have a day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to engage with me about my writing, you can find plenty of ways
to contact me on the &lt;a href="../../about/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; section of my site. However, please
be respectful of my time. Please understand that I receive a large number of
emails and may not be able to respond to everyone. On a more sinister note,
if you send me threats, harassment, or abuse, please be aware that I may share
it with the internet and/or the authorities depending on the content (also, if you
do this you are a bad person and you should feel bad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping the much simpler site management will encourage me to write more, so
that I can share my thoughts with people more often. I hope you will continue to join me on
my little corner of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who might be angry that there are no comments, tough shit. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for ad libbing the idiom &amp;ldquo;low end on the totem pole&amp;rdquo; in my talk. I should know better
and will make sure I do not repeat this if I give the talk again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#transcripts"&gt;Below is a rough initial draft of transcription&lt;/a&gt;. I will work on checking this for typos and other issues in the near future. If anyone has time to help with that,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/juliepagano/juliepagano.com"&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt; would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcripts"&gt;Transcripts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright. So hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Julie Pagano. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer from Pittsburgh, PA. I currently work at the Google offices there. And I&amp;rsquo;m here today to give you a talk entitled &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m here to talk to you today because I love coding. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s not just a job. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing since middle school, but I&amp;rsquo;m involved. I do the Girl Develop It chapter in Pittsburgh. I help organize Steel City Ruby Conf. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly learning because that&amp;rsquo;s something I really enjoy. And I suspect that most of you feel the same way. You&amp;rsquo;re at a conference right now wanting to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we come to these conferences talking about ways to improve. Things like: testing, design patterns, software craftsmanship, tools, and more. But we&amp;rsquo;re missing something. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to focus on your love of coding when you&amp;rsquo;re regularly battling invisible issues like insecurity, anxiety, and lack of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues create hurdles to success. Not just for the individuals who are immediately impacted by them, but for the community at large. People love to joke that programmers are introverts who work alone in the dark in the basement never talking to each other, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the reality. What we do is incredibly communal. We work on teams. Most of us use open source tools, languages. Many of us contribute to open source. And when things go wrong there, we file issues and pull requests. Most of us do code reviews when we write new code. We pair program. We go to user groups. We&amp;rsquo;re at a conference right now. We do mailing lists and irc. What we do is exceptionally communal. And when individuals in those communities are held back from their love of coding, aren&amp;rsquo;t able to reach their potential, the communities aren&amp;rsquo;t reaching their potential either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to talk about this. Ignoring it makes it worse. It&amp;rsquo;s like the adult version of the monsters under the bed. It&amp;rsquo;s scary and isolating because those around you don&amp;rsquo;t understand or actively deny what you&amp;rsquo;re going through. So I&amp;rsquo;m here to talk to you today because I want to shine a little bit of a light on this, so we can talk about it and help those people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on two main things. I want to focus on one of the main issues that impacts people. And then we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk about tools they can use to help themselves, and for those of us who don&amp;rsquo;t have those issues to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets start out with the issues. What are we talking about here? The issue I want to focus on today is something called impostor syndrome. Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think for a second about how that impacts somebody who is a software engineer, a computer programmer. Coding involves regular failure. Most of us fail on a weekly, if not daily basis. We break things. We create bugs. We hit problems that we have difficulty solving or maybe that we can&amp;rsquo;t solve at all. Regular failure. Most of us, we try to even it out by also focusing on our successes, our achievements. So we create a bit of an equilibrium, so that that constant failure doesn&amp;rsquo;t become a drag for us. For people with impostor syndrome, the failure feels larger and the successes dimish, so they lose that equilibrium. They have too much focus on the failure, and that can be really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the people I interviewed in preparation for this talk described it thusly. &amp;ldquo;Victories diminish in importance. Failures loom large.&amp;rdquo; This is what it feels like to suffer from impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impostor syndrome can impact anyone. I interviewed a bunch of people to prepare for this talk, and they cross-cut pretty much every different demographic. There was no specific group that was clearly &amp;ldquo;the group&amp;rdquo; that was impacted by impostor syndrome. There were men. There were women. There were people that had been programming for a year, and people that had been programming for 20, and all sorts of other different groups. I guarantee that most of the people in this room know at least one person who suffers from impostor syndrome. I&amp;rsquo;m also pretty sure that there&amp;rsquo;s people in this room that themselves suffer from impostor syndrome. There&amp;rsquo;s at least one. I have impostor syndrome. ::raises hand:: I&amp;rsquo;ve had impostor syndrome probably for as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a computer programmer, so about middle school. I only learned the name for it about 2 or 3 years ago. That made a really big difference for me because I was able to recognize what was going on and find ways to work through it. It&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m here talking to you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you identify people who have impostor syndrome? Most people don&amp;rsquo;t come up to you and say &amp;ldquo;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Julie. I have impostor syndrome.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple. There&amp;rsquo;s some common things you&amp;rsquo;ll often hear from people, particularly when you talk to them about their achievements. The achievements which they can&amp;rsquo;t internalize. You&amp;rsquo;ll hear things like: &amp;ldquo;I was just luck&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not that smart&amp;rdquo; or maybe even &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not a good programmer.&amp;rdquo; You might hear these things and think that this is modesty, and for some people, it is. But for people who have impostor syndrome, this is not modesty. It is honesty. They mean what they are saying. And the thing that they often don&amp;rsquo;t say out loud, but they think to themselves quite often. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a fraud.&amp;rdquo; This is really the core of impostor syndrome. People who have these issues believe they&amp;rsquo;re frauds, impostors. It&amp;rsquo;s where the name comes from. Not only do they feel that way, but man of them are very afraid of the people around them finding out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you may be saying to yourself &amp;ldquo;but Julie, everyone feels that way sometimes.&amp;rdquo; And that&amp;rsquo;s true. Your average computer programmer probably has a little bit of an up and down with insecurity throughout their careers. Especially when you start a new job. Low end on the totem pole - you don&amp;rsquo;t know as much as everybody else. You feel a little insecure, but it usually levels out. But I want you to understand that there&amp;rsquo;s a difference here between this and what it looks like for people with impostor syndrome. For them it tends to be heightened. There&amp;rsquo;s still ups and downs, but it&amp;rsquo;s always really high. It&amp;rsquo;s a systemic problem. It tends to be long-lasting for them, and it tends to have a lot of negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the negative consequences is that people with impostor syndrome tend to hold themselves back. They often don&amp;rsquo;t share knowledge. Things like speaking at conferences or even just a local user group. Writing blog posts. Because they don&amp;rsquo;t believe that they are good enough. That they have the expertise that&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile to share. They&amp;rsquo;re also very afraid of sharing and getting something wrong and everybody finding out what a fraud they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, they often don&amp;rsquo;t collaborate. A really good example of this that came up is pair programming. If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe you are a good enough programmer, and doubly you&amp;rsquo;re afraid of somebody finding out, imagine how scary pair programming is for you. Having somebody watch you all day long coding. For a lot of people with impostor syndrome this can become a self fulfilling prophecy. They&amp;rsquo;re so anxious about being put in that position that they&amp;rsquo;re focusing a lot of their energy on that anxiety instead of the immediate problem at hand, so they do program not as well as they would have if they were coding by themselves because they&amp;rsquo;re not able to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with impostor syndrome often do not contribute to open source. Again, they feel they don&amp;rsquo;t have the expertise because they devalue their own skills, and they&amp;rsquo;re afraid to contribute in such a public way. We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen those pull requests where somebody decides that whatever the person did was stupid, and everybody jumps on them and makes them feel crappy. People with impostor syndrome have seen that too, and they&amp;rsquo;re terrified of that. That&amp;rsquo;s the case where everybody finally finds out what a fraud you are. So a lot of them don&amp;rsquo;t contribute at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, some people with impostor syndrome don&amp;rsquo;t apply for jobs. Several of the people that I interviewed described being in a position where they were at a dead-end job. They weren&amp;rsquo;t progressing in their career. Or they were being demoralized to the point where they didn&amp;rsquo;t even really like coding any more. And they weren&amp;rsquo;t looking for an exit strategy. They weren&amp;rsquo;t applying for a new job despite there being tons of engineering jobs right now. Because they felt they weren&amp;rsquo;t good enough. That they didn&amp;rsquo;t deserve better. This one hits really close to home for me. I mentioned I work at Google. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked there for about 9 months, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to work there since I graduated from college in 2007. At the time, I looked at Google, said &amp;ldquo;This looks like a sweet place to work. I&amp;rsquo;d really like to work there.&amp;rdquo; I never applied because I felt I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough despite having good grades and work experience. I never tried. Then I got a job somewhere else. After a few years, I became unhappy at that job for a variety of reasons, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really looking for a new job for a long time because I felt I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough to work elsewhere. Throughout this time period, every few months I would look at Google&amp;rsquo;s job listings and say &amp;ldquo;This looks awesome. I wish I had this job,&amp;rdquo; and then I would close the window and never do anything about it. Because, again, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough to work there. So, how did I get the job at Google? A recruiter in Mountain View contacted me, and she spent a good 30, 40 minutes on the phone with me talking me down from my impostor syndrome. Convincing me that it was a good idea for me to interview. That it would be beneficial to me. That they thought I had a good shot. From there, I worked hard, I studied, I got the job, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working there for 9 months. But the reality is it took 5 years longer than maybe it should have. If the recruiter hadn&amp;rsquo;t contacted me, maybe it would&amp;rsquo;ve taken another 5 years. Maybe it would&amp;rsquo;ve never happened at all because my impostor syndrome had convinced me that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another person I interviewed said &amp;ldquo;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel like you have to slay a dragon to get a job.&amp;rdquo; That sounds like hyperbole, and to some degree it is. We all get nervous about interviewing with jobs, but for people who suffer from impostor syndrome, it can feel like it reaches heights of mythical proportions. It&amp;rsquo;s so impossible for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another person I interviewed perfectly described the end result of all this holding yourself back. They said people with impostor syndrome &amp;ldquo;start small.&amp;rdquo; All programmers start small, but they &amp;ldquo;remain small&amp;rdquo; because they hold themselves back in all these different ways because of their impostor syndrome. And they &amp;ldquo;end up small&amp;rdquo; because nobody helps them push past it, and they continue to hold themselves back. This is a little bit scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you may be saying to yourself &amp;ldquo;But Julie, are some of these people you&amp;rsquo;re talking about, maybe they&amp;rsquo;re just bad programmrs. Why do we care?&amp;rdquo; I want to clarify, most people fall roughly along this line. Their perception of their abilities and their actual abilities are roughly in line. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s close. If they were bad programmers and they thought they were bad programmers, they&amp;rsquo;d fall somewhere on this line. People with impostor syndrome, they actually fall somewhere over here. They&amp;rsquo;re actually good programmers, but their perception of their skill is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is there&amp;rsquo;s another group of people that exist in the programming industry that also have a broken perception of their abilities. They suffer from something called the Dunning-Kruger Effect. The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their abililty much higher than average. Those folks live over here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these groups of people exist in the programming industry. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to think about these impact us. The folks with Dunning-Kruger. They think they are hot shit. They think they&amp;rsquo;re awesome. The reality is their abilities are actually fairly low. They often don&amp;rsquo;t know when they make mistakes. They don&amp;rsquo;t realize what they don&amp;rsquo;t know, but they&amp;rsquo;re promoting themselves. On the other side, people with impostor syndrome actually have a decent amount of expertise. They know what they don&amp;rsquo;t know, and they&amp;rsquo;re very clearly aware when they make mistakes, but they hold themselves back because they devalue their skills. I&amp;rsquo;m curious how these two groups of people interplay in our industry and which is actually better for us to have on our teams. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any straightforward answers, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s something people should start to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I mentioned that many people with impostor syndrome hold themselves back. Other people with impostor syndrome push themselves too hard. They believe that they are behind their peers because of their diminished understanding of their own skills, so they try to play catch-up. They start taking on more hours at work, learning more languages, doing more projects, contributing to more open source, going to more conferences, and suddenly they&amp;rsquo;re doing ALL THE THINGS. ALL THE THINGS. And this is not sustainable for any duration of time. When you try to do ALL THE THINGS for an extended period of time you hit something called burnout. Burnout is described as long-term exhaustion and diminished interest in work. When you hit burnout, you no longer love coding. In fact, you kind of hate it. When most people get to this point, they stop learning. Stop doing the activities they were doing outside of work. Most of them get to the point where they basically do the bare minimum not to get fired, and that&amp;rsquo;s all they can manage. For a lot of people this is kind of game over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hits a little close to home for me. Earlier this year, I hit burnout after a year and a half of trying to do all the things. Let me tell you, a year and a half is too long to do ALL THE THINGS. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed it took a year and a half. It was really terrifying when this happened. I withdrew from the activities I was working on. I was doing ok at work, but that was pretty much all I could manage, and I was terrified of how long it was going to last and what the impact would be. Now, I got support, and it lasted about a month. But I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this happen to other people where it lasted 6 months, a year, 6 years, permanent. And when it&amp;rsquo;s permanent or it lasts as long as years, that&amp;rsquo;s game over. Those are people we&amp;rsquo;ve lost. In the industry. In our communities. This is the end result if we let impostor syndrome run rampant without talking about it. Without helping people. This is what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to avoid. This is why I&amp;rsquo;m talking about this today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I&amp;rsquo;ve depressed you a little bit, I&amp;rsquo;m going to move on to giving you some tools we can use to talk about this. To help people. To help ourselves. I&amp;rsquo;m only trying to depress you a little, so that you understand how important this is because it is dangerous to go alone. We need tools to work on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest piece of advice I can give you is &amp;ldquo;build a party.&amp;rdquo; Create a support system of people you care about, that you trust, that you respect. That care about you. These people are your support system. When you have a bad day with impostor syndrome, these are the people you&amp;rsquo;re going to talk to. Another important thing they provide is objective feedback about you. When you have impostor syndrome, your internal evaluation mechanism is broken. You love to look at the things you do wrong. You focus on them too much. You can&amp;rsquo;t focus on what you do well, so you need people you can respect who can give you both positive and negative feedback, but that is constructive. This is criticial to success. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that anyone with impostor syndrome can fight it alone. My party was critical. It&amp;rsquo;s the only reason my burnout only lasted a month because I had an incredibly great support system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that&amp;rsquo;s really important is tracking measurable progress. If you ask us subjective questions like &amp;ldquo;are you a good programmer?&amp;rdquo;, a lot of us will be like &amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;m a shitty programmer.&amp;rdquo; So sometimes you need data, and I know most of us as programmers, we love data, charts, maybe even spreadsheets. If you want to, you could write a ruby app to store all this information. But storing this data, finding progress for yourself, can help you find positive things that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise. One of mine this year was I&amp;rsquo;m going to speak at one conference. This is my third conference this year. By that measure, I&amp;rsquo;m doing pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that&amp;rsquo;s really important on top of that is starting to look for positives. When you have impostor syndrome, again, your internal review is broken. You focus on negatives perfectly well. Positives are harder to find. Start out by getting positives from your party. Move on to tracking your data and getting positives there. And then from there, you need to move on to looking for positives yourself. This can be really hard, but you need to retrain your brain - build a good habit. Maybe you start out once a month. You wite down one thing you do well as a programmer that you consider positive. And then you do it once a week and once a day. Eventually you retrain your brain to do something that many people take for granted. Eventually you can get back to an equlibrium that most people have that you have to work for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t have impostor syndrome, you can help others find those positives. We&amp;rsquo;re really really good as programmers at pointing out when people do things wrong, when they break things. Reminding people of the positive things they do that you appreciate, that have helped you, that are just good code. Tell them. It&amp;rsquo;s great for everybody, but for people who have impostor syndrome, it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly effective and important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the reverse side, you need to avoid some negatives. We all know &amp;ldquo;that person.&amp;rdquo; There seems to be one in almost every community. The &amp;ldquo;hostile geniuses&amp;rdquo; who we keep around because they write good code, but who tend to bring down everybody around them. They have no positive feedback. It&amp;rsquo;s always negative and rarely constructive. These people are like kryptonite for people with impostor syndrome. If you have impostor syndrome, you&amp;rsquo;re already fantastic at putting yourself down. You really don&amp;rsquo;t need people to help. If you have impostor syndrome, identify these people and avoid them if you can. If you can&amp;rsquo;t avoid them, at least identify that they are invalid sources for data about you. You have plenty of good sources: your party, maybe your boss, good coworkers you trust and respect. But these &amp;ldquo;hostile geniuses&amp;rdquo;, they&amp;rsquo;re bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, all of us need to work on avoiding creating negative spaces. This is less malice, and part of it is just our culture. The Hacker School User manual has a really fantastic list of four behaviors that they discourage in their spaces because it creates a bad environment for learning. I think these also create a bad environment for people with impostor syndrome. It makes it hard for them to thrive. Things like no feigning surprise (e.g. &amp;ldquo;Oh my god, you don&amp;rsquo;t know that programming technique that everybody should know. What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with you?&amp;rdquo;). No well-actually&amp;rsquo;s (e.g. &amp;ldquo;well actually, that thing you said is a little bit wrong, and I have to tell you how right I am even though it&amp;rsquo;s completely irrelevant to the discussion&amp;rdquo;). No backseat-driving (e.g. sitting on the other side of the room going &amp;ldquo;No, do it like this. You&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong! You&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong!&amp;rdquo;). And lastly, no subtle sexism (or racism, homophobia, etc.), and I think that last one is self-explanatory. A lot of these things, particularly the first three, they&amp;rsquo;re just kind of built into our culture. We all do it. I know I&amp;rsquo;m especially guilty of the well-actually-ing. I totally do it, but the thing is we get no positive value (or very minimal positive value) from these behaviors. But reducing them, we get value from that. It creates an environment where people with impostor syndrome are more likely to thrive, so I really would recommend all of you think about when you behave this way, and try to reduce it if you can. It helps other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing people with impostor syndrome can do once they&amp;rsquo;ve kind of gotten some of the basics down is helping others. Mentoring, teaching, tutoring. This is good for a couple reasons. One of them is if you have impostor syndrome, you may believe you have nothing valuable to give. You believe you&amp;rsquo;re below your peers and everyone else around you. When you star to help beginners again, you&amp;rsquo;re reminded that you do have something of value to give. You see people learning from you. You see that you can help, and the excitement in them when they&amp;rsquo;re learning how to program and you&amp;rsquo;re helping with it. That can give you a positive that you didn&amp;rsquo;t have before. Another useful thing is that sometimes you get to see what impostor syndrome looks like from the outside early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started teaching classes for the Girl Develop It chapter in Pittsburgh, I saw this in my students. I would be teaching a beginner HTML &amp;amp; CSS class with brand new beginners who&amp;rsquo;ve never done coding before, and they were doing an amazing job for their first class. I would have them look at me and in very serious words say &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t do this&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a bad programmer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not smart enough&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m stupid&amp;rdquo;, and it would break my heart because they were actually doing really well. I realized that that&amp;rsquo;s what I look like sometimes when I have my impostor syndrome, when I put myself down. It gave me a change to be vulnerable with those students. To talk about how I&amp;rsquo;d dealt with these issues, and that it was ok. That they were doing really well. It also made me be a lot more thoughtful about my own impostor syndrome. About how harmful it can be, and that maybe I need to stop putting myself down all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly controversial piece of advice I have is &amp;ldquo;kill your heroes.&amp;rdquo; Not literally. If I catch anybody chasing the other speakers around with a sword later, you&amp;rsquo;re violating the code of conduct. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that. What I mean by kill your heroes is killing the imaginary version of them that we have created in our minds. We do this in the programming community. We definitely do it in the ruby community. We start to look at certain members of our community like these kind of like celebrity god heroes. These magical people who never write bad code. Who were like birthed fully formed wiht a macbook writing amazing ruby code. They have magical powers. It&amp;rsquo;s imbued in them. They never worked for it. When you have impostor syndrome, and you look at people like that, you feel like an ant - maybe even tinier than an ant. You feel like you are so incapable in comparison, and you don&amp;rsquo;t see a path where you could be cool and awesome like them because it&amp;rsquo;s a magical power and you clearly don&amp;rsquo;t have it yet, so that must be it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I really recommend killing that imaginary version of those heroes. Leave the human being that&amp;rsquo;s actually there behind. Cause then you get to see people who actually write bad code. Even our heroes create bugs, break things, make mistakes, and none of them have magical powers. They all started small like the rest of us did, and they worked hard to get where they are. They should be rewarded for working hard, but we should recognize that there&amp;rsquo;s a path there. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re not as awesome as them yet, but you could be if you worked hard enough. That it&amp;rsquo;s not impossible. That it&amp;rsquo;s not magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have my own story about this starring Aaron Patterson, one of our own Ruby heroes, also known as Tenderlove. He&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of those people we look at that way, right. We have all this trivia about him. We know about his cat, Gorbypuff. Some of you probably have stickers of his cat on your laptop. Anybody willing to raise their hand because they do? Yeah, yeah, you guys totally have stickers of his cat on your laptop. He&amp;rsquo;s definitely somebody we look at this way, right? He&amp;rsquo;s a hero. For a long time I really looked at him in that way, as like this magical hero. In particular, about public speaking. Aaron speaks at conferences all the time. He&amp;rsquo;s often one of my favorite speakers when I go to a ruby conference. He&amp;rsquo;s great. I saw him speak at Steel City Ruby last year, and before he spoke he said something that really meant something to me. He said, &amp;ldquo;I get insanely nervous when I give presentations.&amp;rdquo; This feels really small, but it humanized Aaron in a way. He speaks all the time, and he&amp;rsquo;s a great speaker. Despite speaking all the time, he gets insanely nervous. This was really meaningful to me because at the time, a year ago, I was starting to decide &amp;ldquo;do I want to speak at conferences?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;can I speak at conferences.&amp;rdquo; I was terrified of public speaking. Incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;m still terrified of public speaking. I decided because I was so nervous maybe I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it because most of these other speakers, it looked like it just worked for them. I hear Aaron say that he gets insanely nervous, and it really humanized him and reminded me that I can speak too. Aaron gets nervous, doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop him. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be as good a speaker as he is when I start, but maybe some day. It really helped for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last piece of advice I want to give you I heard from just about every person I talked to about impostor syndrome. That&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;fake it &amp;lsquo;til you make it.&amp;rdquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t do this for your technical skills. Putting stuff that you don&amp;rsquo;t actually know on your resume ends badly for just about everybody, but this is fantastic for confidence. For things you&amp;rsquo;re not quite sure you can do. That list of all the ways that people with impostor syndrome hold themselves back. Faking it can help you push past those. You&amp;rsquo;re afraid of public speaking? Maybe you do a 5 minute lightning talk at a local conference or at a local use group. It&amp;rsquo;s five minutes. Even if your talk is terrible, it&amp;rsquo;s only 5 minutes. Nobody will die, and there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance the talk will be fine. Things like applying for jobs. Why not try? What&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen? You don&amp;rsquo;t get the job, and you stay at the dead-end job you were already at? That&amp;rsquo;s going to happen whether you interview for other jobs anyway, but if you interview for jobs and pretend that you&amp;rsquo;re confident enough to work there, maybe one of them is going to believe you. The reality is that it&amp;rsquo;s not that you&amp;rsquo;re not qualified, it&amp;rsquo;s that your impostor syndrome tells you you aren&amp;rsquo;t. So sometimes when you know you have it, you just have to push yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the people I interviewed said &amp;ldquo;the secret to life is pretending you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&amp;rdquo; I really agree with this. I think it&amp;rsquo;s critical for people for people with impostor syndrome. We&amp;rsquo;re always going to have that little nagging voice that says, &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t do that.&amp;rdquo; Sometimes you just have to pretend. Fuck it, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just want to leave you with a few points. Please talk about this. It&amp;rsquo;s really important. Talking about impostor syndrome openly shines a light on it. It makes people who suffer from this feel like they&amp;rsquo;re not alone. If you have impostor syndrome, please help yourself. Try to start using some of the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about. Build a party. Get help. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to stay small. You can work past it. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t have impostor syndrome, please help those around you. As I said, the community as a whole is harmed when people are held back this way. If you care about the software community being great, helping people (many of the ways you help them are easy) is beneficial for everyone. And please everybody enjoy coding. I love it. I want you to keep loving it to. I would love feedback about this talk. You can get me on twitter (@juliepagano) or find me in between and I will tweet my slides some time when I&amp;rsquo;m done. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
