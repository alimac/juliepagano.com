    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this on twitter late last night and again today, but I want to repeat it here for those who missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the message you took from my posts is that we should treat women special, please understand that you got it wrong. We should be making everyone feel welcome in tech. The experiences I described are just my personal examples of areas where we may be falling short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiences I described are largely about being a woman in the tech industry because I am a woman - that’s my lived experience. I cannot speak directly to the experiences of people who are black or transgender or disabled or hispanic or gay or any other number of underrepresented groups that have it just as hard, if not dramatically harder, than people like me. It’s not right for me to try to appropriate their experiences, but many of them are dying from 1000 paper cuts too. They have their own stories to tell, and you should listen to them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not ok with a movement that pushes forward to claim a place for women in tech while leaving other people behind. That’s just moving the goal post, and it’s not sufficient. This isn’t about building a better position for myself (and others like me), it’s about pushing for a better community for everyone. Anything short of that feels like selfish bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a lot of kind words in response to my posts, and I appreciated every one of them. You are good people, and you clearly care. Please share your own stories - I will support you in doing so. I want to hear a multitude of voices, and I don’t want them all to sound like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome you to join me in screaming the only catchphrase that I can seem to muster these days. MY TECHNOLOGY WILL BE INTERSECTIONAL OR IT WILL BE BULLSHIT!!!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href='http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/03/23/my-experiences-in-tech-once-upon-an-internship/' title='My experiences in tech: Once upon an internship'&gt;Once Upon an Internship&lt;/a&gt;, I learned early that sometimes being a software engineer means death by 1000 cuts because you don&amp;#8217;t have the power to make it stop. Even the tiniest little things add up to something big - sometimes it&amp;#8217;s really death by 1000 paper cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cuts started early. I&amp;#8217;m discouraged and humiliated in math classes throughout my school years to the point where I still get anxious doing math in front of others despite being good at it in private.  A high school teacher tells me that I shouldn&amp;#8217;t go to college for engineering, but instead something nurturing (you know, what women are good for).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My college classes have next to no women in them. A professor makes creepy comments about &amp;#8220;geeky girls&amp;#8221; during class. One of my few female classmates tells me she&amp;#8217;s just doing this to prove her father wrong. Classmates don&amp;#8217;t take me seriously until I scream. The first time I learned that you get to be a bitch or you get to be ignored - a choice that would later follow me to the working world. Four years of paper cuts. Four years of pushing myself too hard because I wanted to prove something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every technical conference I attend has at least one person with a microphone making a comment along the lines of &amp;#8221;my wife/girlfriend doesn&amp;#8217;t understand technology and gives me shit for being interested in it.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s clearly intended to be a joke that the audience will identify with, and most of them do because theses conferences are largely straight and male. For those of us who aren&amp;#8217;t, it&amp;#8217;s a regular signal that we&amp;#8217;re not considered, that maybe we don&amp;#8217;t belong. The heavy drinking makes some of us feel unsafe. A paper cut for every conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an old job, someone in authority pats me on the head to dismiss an argument I&amp;#8217;m making about something at work. As though I was a child - a thing he&amp;#8217;d be unlikely to do with a male coworker. Same person makes comments when I wear makeup to work - I feel uncomfortable doing so again. I&amp;#8217;m asked to take notes in meetings where I am a technical lead and should be actively participating. Male coworkers make comments about stalking women on facebook and looking at images of booth babes in work meetings (some later apologize). Others say that front-end development isn&amp;#8217;t real software engineering. I suspect I&amp;#8217;m paid less than male colleagues (perhaps paranoia, perhaps real - it&amp;#8217;s a hard thing to verify). Problems are easiest to resolve by finding a new job - this is what I do (thankfully the new job is much better). A thousand paper cuts for the working world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I try to push to make things better, I am guaranteed a patronizing response from someone. If I had a dollar for every time someone suggested that some demographics just aren&amp;#8217;t biologically predisposed to be good at programming (&lt;a href='http://www.slideshare.net/terriko/how-does-biology-explain-the-low-numbers-of-women-in-cs-hint-it-doesnt'&gt;even though research does not support this argument&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;#8217;d be rich. On more than one occasion, I&amp;#8217;ve had people try to engage me in arguments about the importance of diversity only to later claim they &amp;#8220;were playing devil&amp;#8217;s advocate&amp;#8221; or doing it &amp;#8220;for the lulz.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;ve had people &lt;a href='http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/01/13/thoughts-on-a-diversity-discussion/' title='Thoughts on a diversity discussion'&gt;derail diversity discussions&lt;/a&gt; to victim blame and try to speak for the minority that they were not a member of. I&amp;#8217;ve had people claim minority-only safe spaces are sexist. A paper cut for every time I speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before someone suggests that these patronizing responses are just jerks on the internet, no, that&amp;#8217;s not the case. I get these responses fairly regularly in person. From people I&amp;#8217;ve worked with. From people who know me. From prominent members of some tech communities. From people who should know better. The cuts are deeper when they&amp;#8217;re real people because you can&amp;#8217;t just turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuts I don&amp;#8217;t feel safe posting here because they&amp;#8217;re too personal or I fear the consequences&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mention one of the above, and someone tells me that I&amp;#8217;m just looking for things to get angry about. As though my feelings are not valid. Maybe they don&amp;#8217;t understand that probably wasn&amp;#8217;t the only thing that happened that day or that week or that month or the duration of my career. That I can&amp;#8217;t detach and view these things in isolation. That no matter how tough I get, how thick my skin, the paper cuts still hurt. I&amp;#8217;m not the only one covered in bandaids trying to stanch the bleeding and focus on programming because it&amp;#8217;s a thing that I love. I&amp;#8217;m terrified of the day that it becomes terminal, the day myself or one of my friends becomes another statistic in the book of &amp;#8220;they leave and they don&amp;#8217;t come back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the issues I mentioned in my &lt;a href='http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/03/23/my-experiences-in-tech-once-upon-an-internship/'&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; took place at intern lunches that were optional and off-site at local restaurants. Is professional behavior required at social events between colleagues that don’t take place on company property, time, or expense? I went through my list again and noticed that many of my negative experiences happened in this hazy grey area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who only know me now, you may be surprised to hear that I was once very quiet, reserved, and passive. Early in my career, I was just trying to navigate being in the working world and trying to get along. Sometimes this meant going to the bar after work with coworkers to shoot the shit, complain about work, and just generally socialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rarely minded when these evenings at the bar included some sexualized comments – I was mostly amused by the limited and heterocentric knowledge of my coworkers. We weren’t at work, and I can enjoy a good general sexual joke that isn’t at anyone’s expense. The problem is that conversations didn’t always stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On more than one occasion, talk would veer towards sexualizing female coworkers. It was a comment about how hot one of the new employees was or a joke about looking up the intern’s skirt while she changed lightbulbs (apparently she was asking for it by not wearing pants). Rarely (if ever) were these same coworkers discussed for their merits at their job – in fact sometimes they were discussed negatively in these regards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was assumed this conversation was ok as long as the mentioned parties weren’t there and that nobody in participation minded (again, nobody can hear us). This brings us back to my prior comment about how meek I was then. In these situations, I felt I had a choice: complain and stop getting invited to the bar, or put up with it and get included in social outings with my coworkers. At the time, I chose the latter. I’m still angry with myself about this, but I’m mostly upset that I was put in a position where I had to make a choice like that. These conversations were another reminder that some people in the software industry see women as sex objects first and engineers second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time, a group of coworkers created an after-work club (basically just a group of people going to the bar) with the sole intention of excluding and mocking another coworker they did not like. The name of their club was a twist on the name of a professional organization for minorities this coworker helped organize and was rightly proud of. This kind of behavior made me feel like I’d been transported back to high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who vocally disagreed with this “club” were argued with for not joining the mob. “But &amp;#60;targeted coworker&amp;gt; is lazy and bad at their job.” “Management won’t fire them.” “Their constant mentions of &amp;#60;minority professional organization&amp;gt; are annoying.” “All the cool kids are doing it.” As if any of these things justify bullying. The lack of reflection from the people doing this, many of which were probably bullied in school themselves, was astounding. The club didn’t last long, but the fact that it existed at all disgusts me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it fair to police every action coworkers take in this hazy grey area outside of work? We could probably go round and round about that all day. It’s legitimately difficult to figure out where one should draw those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part that worries me about the incidents described above is not that someone said or did something distasteful outside of work hours. We all do that. What I’m worried about is that these actions are indicative of motivations that also likely infect the professional world. Coworkers would later become managers of the employees they sexualized at the bar. Is that a problem? The “cool kids” club created a mob mentality. Is it easy to turn that off when the mob is at work?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My first experience with working in tech was an internship in college. There were good parts to that experience, but it was also rife with problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who ran the weekly (optional and offsite) intern lunches frequently used it as a platform for his political views, some of which potentially fall into hostile workplace territory. These included diatribes about the immorality of those who use contraception (probably most female interns) and how we should not fund HIV/AIDS research because people with those diseases had earned them with their immoral behavior. I rarely attended the lunches because of this despite them being a good opportunity to network with other interns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For part of this job, I was placed in a small office with a supervisor and two other interns. This supervisor harassed me about attending church with him on more than one occasion despite a clear “no” from me the first time he asked. I was on the road to atheism at that point, but his comments about the evils of Catholicism still rang inappropriate to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This supervisor regularly made homophobic comments (ranging from inappropriate jokes to disgustingly nasty comments) and the other interns often joined in. Most attempts to make this stop (polite comments, trying to wear headphones, etc.) were futile. I wasn’t queer-identified or even a particularly good ally at the time, but these comments still really upset me. I was miserable and started really hating my job. The comments didn’t stop until months later on a day I snapped and was more forceful – saying that they needed to stop. The initial response? “But nobody can hear us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody can hear us. Like I was invisible. That my feelings didn’t matter. Words that showed my previous polite pushing back had not even registered. I explained that I could hear their bigoted comments and threatened to go to HR if they did not cease. It stopped, but things were tense for the rest of my internship. Despite doing an excellent job, I was hesitant to ask for recommendations for fear of retribution over this incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same job where a very senior engineer I had respected told me it didn’t matter if I was good at something because I was nice to look at. An early reminder that to some I was never going to be seen the same as my male colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t I ever report any of the things happened here? I was an intern and the people creating a hostile workplace were in positions of power over me. I was terrified that reporting them would mean all my work as an intern was for naught. That I’d end up with a black mark as “the woman who cried to HR.” That it would cause problems for me with the university who set up the internship. That it would mean no recommendations when I went to get a real job when I graduated. Even then I recognized that HR is there to protect the company, not me. So I mostly put my head down and dealt with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned at this job that being a software engineer sometimes means death by 1000 cuts because you don’t have the power to make it stop. That women are seen differently. That homophobia can run rampant. That people will say whatever the hell they want because they think there are no consequences. They’ll assume it’s ok because you must be in on it too. If nobody can hear them, it must be ok…&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing this afternoon, I just took a long nap. I needed it, but now I’m back to thinking about writing. I’m having a hard time collection my thoughts into words. There’s so much going on in my head right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I can focus on is the past and my personal experiences. Fallout from these incidents usually includes inquiries about how bad the industry really is. When this question came up about a year ago, I wrote a protected post with a huge bulleted list of my negative experiences in the tech industry. I’ve been meaning ever since to share some of it more publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the utility in sharing negative experiences? It’s to show that we’re not just “looking for things to get angry about” – I get this accusation (from both men and women) on occasion. It’s to share solidarity with others who have had similar experiences. It’s to let people know that they’re not alone. And maybe it’s to shock people who didn’t know these things happen into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be adding posts about these experiences. I think it’s easier to break them up than to post one big thing all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll add links to them here as I write:&lt;/p&gt;
